			<p class="fact">The giant pandas are the best known species yet the shyest and rarest animals in the world.</p>
			<ul class="details">
				<li><span class="item">Scientific Name:</span > A. melanoleuca</li>
				<li><span class="item">Average Height:</span > 2-3 ft.</li>
				<li><span class="item">Average Lifespan:</span > 20 years</li>
				<li><span class="item">Habitat:</span > Bamboo forests</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="explain">At first glance, the giant panda would seem to resemble a bear, but in fact its features show it has a stronger affinity with racoons. They are solitary animals spending about two-thirds of its day feeding and the remainder resting.</p>
